### Details of App and Challenges

The application had several interations over the course of creating it. I ended up reverting back a large portion of code when I had a number of dependency issues and errors in react itself. After that, I took the rest of the development VERY slowly, in tiny steps. I struggled pretty heavily trying to make sense of the React framework and it's requirements, especially figuring out how to pass data around between the various components. 

I had help from numerous folks from class including, Jacob Stanger, Miranda D'Asto, Graham Thomas, as well as the staff, Chris Stead, Kurt Lehnardt, and Mike Rivera. Without their troubleshooting, and help, I would not have gotten through piecing this together. It took many more hours of careful, tiny steps and digging into errors than any other project thus far, and I appreciate having good people to help me along the way.
